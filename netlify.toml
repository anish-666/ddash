## Netlify configuration for Docvai Dashboard

# This file defines the build command, publish folder,
# and serverless functions folder for Netlify.  A
# functions folder of `api` means any JavaScript file
# placed under `api/` will automatically be compiled
# and deployed as an AWS Lambda.  The redirect rules
# below route API calls to those serverless functions
# and provide an SPA fallback so your React app can
# handle clientâ€‘side routing.

  # Route all calls under /api/* to the corresponding

  # becomes /.netlify/functions/agents/123.
